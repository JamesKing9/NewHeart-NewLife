Maven is primarily a build tool for Java projects. Java projects can generate different types of
binaries. Typically, the output of a Java project is a `JAR` fle. For web applications, Java classes
combined with other type of files result in a `WAR` or `EAR` file as well. Maven provides plugins
and lifecycle phases to generate various types of binary artifacts for Java projects.



## Building a JAR project

The default type of artifact generated by Maven is `JAR`. If the packaging element is absent,
or specified as `jar`, Maven considers it a `JAR` project. A `JAR` project combines all the source
classes along with the necessary project resources to a single fIle. This `JAR` file can be
distributed for it to be used elsewhere.
