# 3-Setting up the Development Environment

The following steps describe how to set up your development environment. In the process, you'll learn about some of the primary windows of the IDE and understand how the IDE uses an Ant build script to perform common actions on your project. By the end of this tutorial unit, you'll have created a web application project, and confirmed that you can successfully build the project, deploy it to your development server, and run it from the IDE.

You also learn how to connect the IDE to a MySQL database server, create database instances, and connect to database instances from the IDE's Services window. In this unit, you create a new database named affablebean, which you will use throughout the tutorial.
