A **Java virtual machine** (**JVM**) is [an abstract computing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_virtual_machine) that enables a computer to run a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)) program. 

There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance. 

The specification is a document that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation. Having a 
single specification ensures all implementations are [interoperable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability).
 A JVM implementation is a computer program that meets the requirements 
of the JVM specification. 

An instance of a JVM is an implementation running in a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) that executes a computer program compiled into [Java bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode).
